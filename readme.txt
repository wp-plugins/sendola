Clicking the Sendola button on your website will open a small form allowing your users to send your contact details to their phones. This means they will find it easier to contact and visit you or your business. This in turn could help you get more business.

Details sent can include phone number, map, address, opening times, payment details, images, directions, streetview etc.

The plugin connects with your Sendola account (from www.sendola.com), and lets you add a Sendola button to a page or post very quickly. You can also use shortcodes to tell the page which button you want to display.

Using Sendola is completely free for both website owners and visitors. Sendola is a great  plugin for contact us forms, about us, or location pages.
