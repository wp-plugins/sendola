Free plugin to send contact details & map to website visitorsâ€™ mobile cell phone. Make it easy for visitors to contact and find you.


== Description ==
Add the unique Sendola button to your Wordpress site, and let your website visitors send your contact details to their phones.

Clicking the Sendola button on your website will open a small form allowing your users to send your contact details to their phones. This means they will find it easier to contact and visit you or your business. This in turn could help you get more business.

Details sent can include phone number, map, address, opening times, payment details, images, directions, streetview etc.

The plugin connects with your Sendola account (from www.sendola.com), and lets you add a Sendola button to a page or post very quickly. You can also use shortcodes to tell the page which button you want to display.

Using Sendola is completely free for both website owners and visitors. Sendola is a great  plugin for contact us forms, about us, or location pages.


== Installation ==

Using Wordpress dashboard:

1. Login to your Wordpress site
2. Go to Plugins
3. Select Add New
4. Search for "Sendola"
5. Select Install
6. Select Install Now
7. Select Activate Plugin


Manual installation:

1. Download the Sendola plugin zip file and unzip
2. Upload the entire Sendola folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in Wordpress.
4. You can access settings through "Settings" > "Sendola" within Wordpress.


Add your plugin key to activate the plugin. You must have a Sendola.com account for the plugin to work. Log into your Sendola account and visit the Plugins page to find your plugin key. Copy and paste the key into the text box and click the "Update key" button.

Any existing Sendola buttons you have set up for your domain will automatically be displayed in the Sendola plugin settings. If no buttons are displayed, log into your account at Sendola.com and set up a new button, ensuring the domain for the new button is the same as that of your Wordpress site.

Adding, editing and deleting Sendola buttons must be done on Sendola.com. Any changes you make to a button (e.g. updating phone numbers, address details etc.) will automatically be reflected in the content that is sent to your website visitors when they use the button.

To use the Sendola button on your Wordpress site, you can copy and paste the Shortcode (e.g. [sendola id=1234]) from the relevant button listed in the Sendola settings page into the Wordpress page editor.

You can also add the button from within the page editor by clicking the Sendola icon and selecting the relevant button.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does Sendola cost? =
Sendola is completely free to use. Neither the Sendola account holder or the Sendola user pays anything to use the Sendola service. We don't ask for any payment details either, so you can't be charged without knowing!

= How do I get Sendola working on my website? =
After installing the plugin, simply copy and paste the shortcode from the Sendola plugin settings page into the page you want the button to appear. You must have previously opened a Sendola.com account (free, takes about 1 minute) and entered the plugin key into the Sendola Wordpress plugin settings page.

To make the button most effective, make sure it appears next to or just below your written contact details. This can be on the contact us page, or any other page/area where you list your contact details.
